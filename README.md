###Bash Backup Rotation Script

###Description
This script allows you to create a backup rotation for your files and mysql database. The backup target can be local or remote (FTP). 

The script has 3 backup types

- Daily backup
- Weekly backup (default : perform every sixth day of the week)
- Monthly backup (default : perform every first day of the month)

This script allows you to customize where to backup each `backup type`. For example you can choose to do daily and weekly backup on local machine and monthly backup on a FTP server.

Each type of backup will have a backup retention(copy). The default retention for every type of backup can be configured. 

The backup retention default day is :

*   Daily backup : 5 Day ( 5 daily backups )
*   Weekly backup : 14 Day ( ~2 weekly backups )
*   Monthly backup : 30 Day ( ~1 Monthly backups )

Please consider your storage size when chosing retention settings.

##1. Usage Instruction

1. Download the `backup_rotation.sh` script into your NIX server.

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/todiadiyatmo/bash-backup-rotation-script/master/backup_rotation.sh

2. Open the file using your favourite editor (ex :`nano` or `vim`)

		nano backup_rotation.sh

	or
	
		vim backup_rotation.sh

3. Edit the configuration file. MYSQL configuration, for minimal `BACKUP_DIR`, `TARGET_DIR` must be filled. 

		# The directory to be backup , DO NOT END THE DIRECTORY WITH BACKSLASH ! 
		TARGET_DIR=/target_directory
		
		# The backup directory , DO NOT END THE DIRECTORY WITH BACKSLASH ! 
		SOURCE_DIR=/your_backup_direcory
		
		# Admin email
		MAIL="your_email@email.com"
		
		# Number of day the daily backup keep
		RETENTION_DAY=5
		
		# Number of day the weekly backup keep
		RETENTION_WEEK=14
		
		# Number of day the monthly backup keep
		RETENTION_MONTH=30
		
		#Monthly date backup option (day of month)
		MONTHLY_BACKUP_DATE=1
		
		#Weekly day to backup option (day of week - 1 is monday )
		WEEKLY_BACKUP_DAY=6

4. Make the script executable

		chmod +x backup_rotation.sh

5. Test the script (sudo may be required)

		bash backup_rotation.sh

6. If the script runs correctly the file will be available in `TARGET_DIR`. Try to extract the file and check the contents

		tar -xJfv [filename].tar.xz

7. To make the backup run daily, put it in a crontab
	
		crontab -e

		#put this line in crontab
		#This will run it 10 minutes after midnight.
		10 0 * * * [path to your backup_rotation.sh]
		#or
		10 0 * * * cd [path to bash-backup-rotation-script folder] && ./backup.sh

8. If crontab is not available, consult your distributions packages. Ubuntu Server includes it by default.

##2. Backup Type Configuration

To customize the `backup type` you must alter the `LOCAL_BACKUP_OPTION` and `FTP_BACKUP_OPTION` in the configuration script.

The configuration value of `LOCAL_BACKUP_OPTION` and `FTP_BACKUP_OPTION` can be view on the table below

![Backup type configuration](http://todiadiyatmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Selection_105.png)

For example, if you want to do a daily backup on local and weekly on FTP you must fill both options like this:

	LOCAL_BACKUP_OPTION=1
		
	FTP_BACKUP_OPTION=2
